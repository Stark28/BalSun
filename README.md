java assignment1

Basic Introduction of the code we made

Task 1:
We follow the solution in Java Programming V and divide them to different classes. We created several arraylist of sections 
we need and return the list and print them in the main class.

Task 2:
In the task, we created an SQL database using MYSQL localhost server connecting it to the JAVA code over a secure establishment with username and password.
Similarly we have created a DB for every CIM object and for every data inside in it. Then we pushed the information from the list to SQL DB creating a relational DB locally.

Task 3:
In task 3, firstly, we need to figure out how the circuit looks, we read the information from EQ file as what we did in Task1. Terminal, connectivity node, busbarsection, ac line, transformer, shunt capacitor.
We make the matrix showing the relationship between these stuffs. 
Then check which equipment(ac line, transformer, shunt capacitor) connect to which terminal and caiculate the impedance and admittance of the equipment and put them to the corresponding Ybus matrix element.
The detailscan be seen in the Java code.


Thank you!
